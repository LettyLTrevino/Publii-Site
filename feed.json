My dissertation explores the experiences of U.S. Latinas in Predominantly White Educational Spaces. Part of my research is creating digital stories that illuminate different hurdles U.S. Latinas face in higher education. I'm centering our experiences as those experiences that are most important. Our stories are both the primary sources and the analysis of this experience. Those are all wordy things to say: what we have to say is important, and our stories are enough for a dissertation. The final will be my first version of this podcast.</p>",
